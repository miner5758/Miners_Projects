During this project, I was familiarizing myself with the OS module in Python so I made this to help me understand some of its uses, this program takes arguments and then based on them can create files and directories.

How to use the program:

In order to create a folder in your current directory, you would have to do this, example: create_folder('h','Default')

In order to create a folder in a different directory, you would have to do this, example: create_folder('e','Downloads')

In order to create a folder inside a folder, you would have to do this, example create_folder('e','Downloads\\e')
