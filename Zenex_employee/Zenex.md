This folder Is home to a project that i have been working on for about 4 months now and my first and ultimate object oriented python project, when first learning OOP in python they usually first start out by describing it to you using employees. This project is essentially a much more advanced version of that using Openpyxl to edit a xlsx file and make changes to the the employee inside the file like changes their salary and promoting them just to name a few, there is a hirarchy that prevents certain people from editing certain employees, the reason i named it Zenex is because Zenex is what i want to name my future company once i start it! If your seeing this then thank you for taking the time ton check out my directory on this!
