# Miners Projects
This github repository is almost a exact copy of the folder in my computer where all my projects are stored and stuff related to those projects like excel files, png's, jupyter notebooks and more.
Im a young new programmer learning how to program in python and as i countinue to build up my skills in this laungauge the more complicated the projects i take on will become,
an example of this is how when you look at my projects you'll see how in one of them called "Titanic tutorial" I was following a pandas tutorial teaching the fudimentals on using pandas.
Then later as you can see in the project "pres" i went on to download, clean and plot my own data using what i had learned, using github not only do i want to show my progress overtime 
through the progression of my projects i also want to commemorate all these projects in a place where i and others can come and look at them in the future. After all of these have taken
an immense amount of effort and time put into them, it would be a waste to discard them. I will try to to update this repository as much as i can and hopefully in the near future 
this will be the home to a legendary computer programmers code.(PS, when im using pd.read_csv or read_excel in my projects  I removed my home directory for privacy reasons so that's why it may look a werid and broken, same thing for the os module. And the "juniors notebook file is incomplete)
